hedge parameters (haxe -D option)

MISSING OR ACTS DIFFERENT

	renaming all getter and setters from getSomething -> get_something, feel its easier to read. Taste change :)

	hedge.display.DisplayObject
		-	cacheAsBitmap
		-	opaqueBackground
		-	scaleX/Y - in test DisplayObject_WidthExample at large value changes object starts to get blured. Test uses svg element. Might have to use native svg scale instead of css scale.
	
	hedge.display.InteractiveObject
		-	keyFocusChange event
		-	mouseFocusChange event
		-	tabChildrenChange event
		-	tabEnabledChange event
		-	tabIndexChange event
		
	hedge.text.TextField
		-	setDefaultTextFormat - need to implement bullet - each paragraph <p> into unordered list <ul> ?
		-	autosize - flash version seems to be 4px more on both width and height.
	
	hedge.text.TextFormat
		-	kerning	- doesnt apply
		-	tabStops- dont know what it is
		-	url		- dont think I will implement it
		-	autoSize- LEFT, CENTER, RIGHT dont do anything but allow the textfield to resize on its own. NONE works as normal.
		
	hedge.events.Event
		-	Event now takes a type param T. Allows you to use e.target.alpha = 0.5 without having to cast e.target to displayObject to access alpha's getter and setter functions.
		
DIRET JS __PROTO__ EDITING
	hedge.events.internal.HedgeEnterFrame
		-	adding __HEFUID__ property to passed function, so we can track it.
