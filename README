If your looking for a flash to html5 library - look at Jeash, its awesome - https://launchpad.net/jeash

WORKING - kind of
-----
I will try and keep this up todate on whats completed.

All graphics method are working apart from the following:
	beginBitmapFill		-	not implemented
	beginGradientFill		-	either due to lack of svg support in all browsers or I'm not understanding something
	lineGradientStyle		-	not implemented - pretty sure not supported by raphaeljs - but svg spec does allow this

NOTES
-----
This project started just because I've never really had to use javascript for work so I've never used jQuery / Raphael.
Andy_li created extern classes for both jQuery and Raphael - so they are/will be used alot through out this code.

jQuery extern library - https://github.com/andyli/jQueryExternForHaxe
Raphaeljs extern library - https://github.com/andyli/raphaelExternForHaxe

So cheers to him - as I think coding a substantial amount of code in normal js would drive me mad.

This project (at the moment) is just for me to play around with the js target. I've already re-written the little code
there is about 3 times and I've started again on the vector part. As I learn more about the js target I normally find
a better way to code what I've already coded.

It was originally called jshx - couldnt think of a better name than that - then when I was watching Adobe MAX
a preview of edge - Adobes html5 prototype was shown - so I had to rename this to hedge.

I've only really tested the little code there is in Chrome - trying to replicate the SWF output as I go along.
