03/01/2011 12:08 javascript error with haxe build r3578 but works fine with haxe build r3577 - not sure
whats causing it...

WORKING - kind of
-----
I will try and keep this up todate on whats completed.

Graphics:
beginBitmapFill     -  not implemented
beginGradientFill   -  either due to lack of svg support in all browsers or I'm not understanding something
lineGradientStyle   -  not implemented - pretty sure not supported by raphaeljs - but svg spec does allow this
clear               -  works, but does not reduce parent size which the swf version does

NOTES
-----
The example bunny blit borrowed from Iain Lobbs as3 code [1]. His html5 example [2] is faster than hedge, but hedge is
not optimized, but seems to run 3000 bunnies at 15 fps better than at 30 fps.

Looking at svgweb - might be better solution than using raphaeljs. I'm only using raphaeljs to render - at moment no
animation.

Not using any thirdparty js library for canvas but there is bitmapdata.js as an alternative [3]

canvas 2d context method drawImage is alot faster than method putImageData etc.

REASON
-----
This project started just because I've never really had to use javascript for work so I've never used jQuery / Raphael.
Andy_li created extern classes for both jQuery and Raphael - so they are/will be used alot through out this code.

jQuery extern library - https://github.com/andyli/jQueryExternForHaxe
Raphaeljs extern library - https://github.com/andyli/raphaelExternForHaxe

So cheers to him - as I think coding a substantial amount of code in normal js would drive me mad.

This project (at the moment) is just for me to play around with the js target. I've already re-written the little code
there is about 3 times and I've started again on the vector part. As I learn more about the js target I normally find
a better way to code what I've already coded.

It was originally called jshx - couldnt think of a better name than that - then when I was watching Adobe MAX
a preview of edge - Adobes html5 prototype was shown - so I had to rename this to hedge.

I've only really tested the little code there is in Chrome - trying to replicate the SWF output as I go along.
